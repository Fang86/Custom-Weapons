# Custom Weapons
This mod allows you to shoot weapons with your own settings. You can set your RPM (rounds per minute), spread, ammo type (rockets or bullets), bullets per shot, infinite ammo, burst firing mode, and recoil/flash visibility! 

## How much can you change your custom gun?
- **RPM** ranges from 10 to 10000 
- **Spread** ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 having the most spread
- You can change your ammo type from bullets to **ROCKETS**!
- **Bullets per shot** ranges from 1 to 100. However, the game gets very laggy when its set to 100, so make sure your rpm isnt too high!
- **Burst speed** ranged from 60 to 2000. This controls the speed between each shot in a burst with the higher number making it faster
- **Burst shots** ranges from 2 to 10 rounds per burst.
- **Set a tool** that the mod is restricted to


## How to use:
 1. Enable the mod in the game's main menu
2. [b][u]Press "M" to open up the menu[/u][/b] (this also closes the menu)
3. You should now see options to change the RPM, spread, and bullets per shot. You should also see buttons to toggle Modded weapon, Rocket ammo, Infinite ammo, Burst firing mode, and a Recoil/Flash hider.
	- **Modded weapon** allows you to shoot with the given RPM and spread. It will work on any tool as long as you hold the mouse button down. It is enabled by default.
	- **Rocket ammo** allows you to shoot rockets (while "Modded weapon" is on) at the given RPM and spread.
	- **Infinite ammo** allows you make all normal weapon ammo infinite. The modded weapon ammo is inherently infinite, so you do not need this on unless you are not using modded weapon.
	- **Burst mode** allows you to shoot in bursts with custom rounds per burst and delay per shot in each burst
	- **Recoil/Flash** allows you to hide the initial flash and recoil when shooting with the mod
	- **Mod's HUD** allows you to hide or show the new HUD in v1.2.

**Note:** This project has been mostly abandoned, but I might pick it up again eventually. I did post a minor update 3/11/2021 to fix the origin of the bullets - this may be the last update
